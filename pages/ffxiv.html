                    <p>One of my primary hobbies is playing the MMO Final Fantasy 14. I enjoying leveling jobs, crafting gear, and collecting various items.</p>
                    <h2>Taerqun Qalli</h2>
                    <p>Taerqun Qalli is an <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Au_Ra">Au Ra</a> (humanoid characters with horns, scales, and tails). Au Ra can hear and sense things through their horns, similar to humans' ears. Taerqun is from the in-game region called the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Azim_Steppe#Activities">Azim Steppe</a>, which is on the continent of Othard. This region is populated by tribes of nomadic Au Ra of the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Xaela">Xaela clan</a>. Taerqun's surname indicates that she is a member of the Qalli tribe, whose members hold music and singing in high importance</p>
                    <p>Taerqun is more of a tomboy and wears darker, edgier clothing than most of her tribe. She learned to fight to represent her tribe in the annual <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Naadam">Naadam</a>. She was noticed for her martial prowess and became acquainted with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn during their time in the Azim Steppe. When more warriors were needed to accompany the Scions to Tural, Taerqun decided to join them.</p>
                    <h2>F'hyrran Rae</h2>
                    <p>I have another character, F'hyrran Rae, who is a <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Miqo%27te">Miqo'te</a> (humanoid characters with cat ears and tails). The Miqo'te live throughout the continent of <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Eorzea">Eorzea</a>. F'hyrran is a <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Seekers_of_the_Sun">Seeker of the Sun</a>, which is one of two clans of Miqo'te. Most Seekers are a member of a "letter tribe" denoted by the first letter of their first name; F'hyrran's tribe is 'F'. The tribe letter is pronounced as part of the name with most people. Close friends and family can drop the letter as an affectionate, casual way to refer to a Seeker. Seekers mostly live on the western side of Eorzea and are distinguished from their <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Keepers_of_the_Moon">Keeper of the Moon</a> counterparts by their smaller, narrower pupils.</p>
                    <p>F'hyrran loves to dye her hair different colors! She is more interested in supporting her fellow party members than dealing the most damage or being the strongest.</p>
                    <p>Below is art of F'hyrran and one of my partner's characters called Emile. It was made on commission from my friend <a href="https://artyarts.carrd.co/#">Arty Arts</a>.</p>
