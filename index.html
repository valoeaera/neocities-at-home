        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! I created this site because I am super burnt out on programming from work and wanted to make something I enjoyed. My day job as a software developer pays the bills, but it doesn't provide me with a creative outlet for programming. It's very corporate drone!</p>
        <p>The site doesn't have much on it right now, but I want this to be a place I can go make art and cute things and write about topics that bring me joy.</p>
